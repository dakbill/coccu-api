2.  I suggest a check should be indicated on every member page, and that check
    should justify or confirm that a member can be granted loan or not,
    but if he/she does not qualify then the guarantor comes in and that process could be done manually by checking - done
3.  I suggest any information need to be filled about the person should be done,
    please is possible the system could allow taller to capture image of members for registration? - done
8.  Sale of Passbook & Registration - done
7.  Savings Withdrawal - done
9.  Administrative Expense - done
4.  Repayment - Principal plus Interest. - done
2.  I know provision would be made for the members number but the receipt number must also be captured to facilitate easy tracking
    during dispute. - done
3.  Give out Loan - Principal plus Interest  - done


4.  And in the user profile interface , the information required there,
    canâ€™t give CU officers much details to track a member when he or she refuses to pay a loan

1.  system alerting customers on their due date of paying loans and also alert
    them when their account becomes dormant for 3 months. And also teller
    should also get alert on the system too.

4.  Must have mechanism to flash those who are unable to make their loan repayment after 1 week.

Outstanding loan = A loan whose repayment is missed within the stipulated period of repayment

Defaulted loan = A loan whose repayment is missed beyond the stipulated period of repayment

Can these be segmented For example
* Loans
   - give out loans - done
   - loan repayment - done
   - outstanding loans
   - defaulted loans
* Payment
    - deposit - done
    - withdrawal - done
